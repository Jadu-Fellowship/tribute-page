        Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and
        illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki,
        a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of
        becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two
        parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his
        teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri
        (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's
        monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
